#--------------- CORE ---------------#
No changes to core

#--------------- superfish.module ---------------#
In order to make superfish compatible with the menu_firstchild module I edited
the superfish.module file exactly as outlined in this comment:
http://drupal.org/node/1126574#comment-5149676
Note: This fix has been committed to the v1.9-beta3

#--------------- views_slideshow_simple_pager -----------------#
This is a sandbox module (http://drupal.org/sandbox/longwave/1340916) that
improves views_slideshow by allowing pagers to work on node views (as opposed to
field views). In addition I applied the patch found here
http://drupal.org/node/1631782#comment-6111594 to make the pager links
clickable.
